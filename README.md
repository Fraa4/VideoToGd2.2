# VideoToGd2.2
A program that converts videos from Geometrize to Geometry Dash. Only available on Windows.

# Requirements
- [GDShare](https://geodesdk.org/mods/hjfod.gdshare/) and [WSLiveEditor](https://geodesdk.org/mods/iandyhd3.wsliveeditor/), which are available on the modloader [Geode](https://geodesdk.org)
- 4GB Patch (not required but recommended)
- Atleast 1GB of free space in disk

# How to use
- Download the program from [Releases](https://github.com/Fraa4/VideoToGd2.2/releases).
- Open VideoToGd.exe
- Select a video (mp4, avi or gif)
- Select import method
- Write numbers of shapes per frame
- Select the shapes (they will be used in the frame)
- Write numbers of frames
- Write numbers of FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Write numbers of frame skip (frame skip in actual video, if video is 60 FPS you can put 30 FPS and 2 frame skip to make it play at the same speed)
- Select the resolution (if you put more than 100, the quality will practically not change, but the import speed will be slower)
- Write numbers of shapes per refresh
- Write numbers of mutations (the higher the number, the more the shapes will change)
- Write number of scale (do not go above 5)
- Click next

Sometimes the file can freeze at the last frame, if it's staying there for longer then usual you can stop the app, it's finished but it's not showing, one method to see if it's finised is that if you're using WSLiveEditor you should see a static camera trigger, if it's there the program has finished.
