VIDEO CONVERTER FROM GEOMETRIZE TO GEOMETRY DASH

IMPORTANT
-This app is compatible only with Windows
-GdShare is required to import the level once the script finishes
-4gb patch is highly recommended
-The script can take a very long time to run, if you decide that you want to stop the generation you can close the cmd window and then run the "quick import.py" to
import just the frames it has generated or insted you can change settings and just run the exe again, once you stop the program it's not resumable, it has to start over.
-Your antivirus could detect this program as a virus, this is because the program is using a batch command to run the geometrize function, if the program has any problem try
disabling your antivirus before contacting me.
-This program can use a significant amount of disk space while it's running, make sure you have at least 1gb of disk space, the program deletes the files at the end of the process by itself.


Use:
-Select a video (mp4,avi,gif) and move into the GeomToGd folder
-Open the config.txt file and change the "Src" to the name of the file (include the extension: "video.mp4") 
DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMATTING OF THE CONFIG FILE AND DO NOT ADD LINES BETWEEN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
-You can change other settings in the config.txt file.
-Save the file and open the GeomToGd.exe file.
-once the cmd window closes the level.gmd file should be changed
-Open Geometry Dash 2.2 and import the file using GdShare
