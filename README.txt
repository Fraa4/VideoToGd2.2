VIDEO CONVERTER FROM GEOMETRIZE TO GEOMETRY DASH

IMPORTANT
-This app is compatible only with Windows
-GdShare or WSLiveEditor are required, you can get them using Geode
-4gb patch is highly recommended
-The script can take a very long time to run, if you decide that you want to stop the generation you can close the cmd window and then run the "quick import.py" to
import just the frames it has generated or insted you can change settings and just run the exe again, once you stop the program it's not resumable, it has to start over.
-Your antivirus could detect this program as a virus, this is because the program is using a batch command to run the geometrize function, if the program has any problem try
disabling your antivirus before contacting me.
-This program can use a significant amount of disk space while it's running, make sure you have at least 1gb of disk space, the program deletes the files at the end of the process by itself.


Use:
-Open VideoToGd.exe
-Select a video (mp4,avi,gif)
-Select import metod (see below)
-Write numbers of Shapes per frame
-Select the shapes (they will be used in the frame)
-Write numbers of frames
-Write numbers of FPS(frames per second)
-Write numbers of frame skip(Frame skip in actual video, if video is 60 fps you can put 30fps and 2 frame skip to make it play at the same speed)
-Select the resolution(if you put more than 100, the quality will practically not change, but the import speed will be slower)
-Write numbers of shapes per refresh
-Write numbers of mutations(the higher the number, the more the shapes will change)
-Write number of scale(do not go above 5)
-Click next
-sometimes the file can freeze at the last frame, if it's staying there for longer then usual you can stop the app, it's finished but it's not showing, one method to see if it's finised is
that if you're using WSLIVEEDITOR you should see a static camera trigger, if it's there the program has finished

GMD IMPORT
This method uses GDShare, simply start the exe file and at the end of the script when the windows closes you will see a "level.gmd" file in the "Files" folder, open GD and 
go to the Create tab, then click the GDShare button and select that file, now a level should have appeared in the top of your created levels.

WSLIVEEDITOR
This method uses the WSLIVEEDITOR mod created by IAndyHD3, install it and create a new level, then while GD is running in the background start the script.
You should start seeing objects appearing in the level, wait for it to finish.
It's recommended that you use an empty level for this, the groups are not customizable and the object position is fixed.
Note that you need to stay in the editor in order to make the script work.
