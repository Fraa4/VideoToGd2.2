VIDEO CONVERTER FROM GEOMETRIZE TO GEOMETRY DASH

IMPORTANT
-This app is compatible only with Windows
-GdShare or WSLiveEditor are required, you can get them using Geode
-4gb patch is highly recommended
-The script can take a very long time to run, if you decide that you want to stop the generation you can close the cmd window and then run the "quick import.py" to
import just the frames it has generated or insted you can change settings and just run the exe again, once you stop the program it's not resumable, it has to start over.
-Your antivirus could detect this program as a virus, this is because the program is using a batch command to run the geometrize function, if the program has any problem try
disabling your antivirus before contacting me.
-This program can use a significant amount of disk space while it's running, make sure you have at least 1gb of disk space, the program deletes the files at the end of the process by itself.


Use:
-Select a video (mp4,avi,gif) and move into the GeomToGd folder
-Open the config.txt file and change the "Src" to the name of the file (include the extension: "video.mp4") 
DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMATTING OF THE CONFIG FILE AND DO NOT ADD LINES BETWEEN THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
-You can change other settings in the config.txt file.
-Save the file and open the GeomToGd.exe file.
-Based on the last option of the config.txt "method" the way the level is imported in the level changes, the way they work is explained below:

METHOD 0 OR GMD IMPORT
This method uses GDShare, simply start the exe file and at the end of the script when the windows closes you will see a "level.gmd" file in the folder, open GD and 
go to the Create tab, then click the GDShare button and select that file, now a level should have appeared in the top of your created levels.

METHOD 1 OR WSLIVEEDITOR
This method uses the WSLIVEEDITOR mod created by IAndyHD3, install it and create a new level, then while GD is running in the background start the script.
You should start seeing objects appearing in the level, wait for it to finish.
Note that you need to stay in the editor in order to make the script work.


-once the cmd window closes the level.gmd file should be changed
-Open Geometry Dash 2.2 and import the file using GdShare
